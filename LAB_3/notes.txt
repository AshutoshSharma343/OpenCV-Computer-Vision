Digital Image Processing --> input image --> output image
Digital image processing is a field of study and a set of techniques used to manipulate and analyze
 digital images. It involves the use of algorithms and mathematical operations to enhance,
 modify, or extract information from images.
Image Segmentation--> know which is the background and foreground
Enhancement
Compression

Computer Vision --> input as image and output as a description of the image.


Image Scailing-->
involves resizing an image
we have some edge detection algorithms which gives us the edges
so we need to get the edges are change them to do rescailing.

Image Rotation-->
Rotating involves Rotating an image by a specified angle.
